## Farming Reward Allocations
Final Gemini farming reward allocations (excluding Aries stress test and Stake Wars 1) can be found in the [CSV file](https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets/blob/main/Final_farming_rewards.csv).

### Aries Stress Test
Detailed breakdown of the data can be found in the [XLSX file](https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets/blob/main/Aries%20Stress%20Test.xlsx) which was created as follows:
1. Identify all wallets that participated in the Aries stress test.
2. Determine Gemini rewards for each wallet.
3. Any with a non-zero Gemini rewards balance have an equal share of the 0.01% allocation.

### Gemini Breakdown
Detailed breakdown of all incentivized testnets and exact calculation formulas can be found in the [XLSX file](https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets/blob/main/Subspace%20Testnet%20Token%20Distribution%20List_calculations_FINAL.xlsx) which was created as follows:
1. Calculate all tokens that were generated during each testnet period Gemini 1, 2, 3f and 3g  (total number of tokens)
2. Calculate all rewards that were generated during each testnet period 3h pool 1 and 3h pool 2  (total number of rewards)
3. Create a pivot table to list each wallet's participation in each testnet category
4. Calculate the relative reward for each wallet for each testnet (reward / total number of rewards)
   
### Gemini 1
1. Calculate the relative reward for each wallet
    1. Distribute the allocation of 0.3% to all wallets proportional to their relative reward
    2. Count all wallets that have participated in Gemini 1 (reported number 13,106) and divide 0.2% by the number of wallets
2. Add this amount to all wallets that have participated in Gemini 1
   
### Gemini 2
**First Incentive:**
1. Calculate the relative reward for each wallet
2. Distribute the allocation of 0.05% to all wallets proportional to their relative reward

**Second Incentive (only wallets with 3 tSSC balance are qualified):**
1. Calculate the relative reward for each wallet
2. Distribute the allocation of 0.5% to all wallets (only above 3tSSC) proportional to their relative reward

### Gemini 3
1. Determine the proportions of each testnet for 3f-3h pool 1 (numbers of blocks generated during the testnet divided by the number of all blocks)
2. Determine the total relative reward during 3f-3h pool 1 proportional to the testnet block count for each wallet
3. Determine the relative reward during 3h pool 2 for each wallet
4. Determine the aggregated token allocation for each testnet period (i.e. 0.1% * number of weeks for 3f-3h pool 1 and 0.05% * number of weeks for 3h pool 2)
5. Multiply the relative reward of each wallet with the aggregated token allocation for each testnet period
6. Multiply the relative allocation of each wallet with the token supply (1B token) to get the absolute number of tokens per wallet

## Stake Wars 1 Allocations
Can be found in the [XLSX File](https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets/blob/main/Stake%20Wars%201.xlsx). An explanation of the rewards structure can be found on [the Autonomys forum](https://forum.autonomys.xyz/t/stake-wars-introduction/2060#rewards-9).
